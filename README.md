# Use-Case-3 DEMO running on Phoenix-RTOS

This is the COGNIT Energy Use Case demo application that is meant to be run on a Smart Energy Meter. The application communicates and controles energetically important household devices (whose simulations are to be found in [use-case-3](https://github.com/SovereignEdgeEU-COGNIT/use-case-3) repository). The meter controls the mentioned devices according to the result of an AI decision model, which is offloaded to the COGNIT Edge Cluster with the help of the COGNIT device client [device-runtime-c](https://github.com/SovereignEdgeEU-COGNIT/device-runtime-c).

This is a fork of [phoenix-rtos-project](https://github.com/phoenix-rtos/phoenix-rtos-project). Documentation of the system, together with the building instructions can be found there.
